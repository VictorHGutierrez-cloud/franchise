# 🏢 Davyn Franchise Business Model
## Expansion Unit - Replicable Success Framework

*"A franchise works because it provides a replicable business model with predictable ROI, in exchange for following a playbook."*

---

## 📖 Story + Concept

### The Thesis

**Davyn is the franchise expansion unit of Factorial**, a proven successful HR technology platform. We've demonstrated that the Caribbean market has strong demand for comprehensive HR solutions, and we've built a playbook that works.

### The Opportunity

The Caribbean HR technology market is underserved. Most competitors offer fragmented, single-purpose tools (ATS, LMS, payroll, time & attendance) rather than integrated HR suites. Local players are outdated, and few providers can offer multi-country coverage with local support.

**Davyn has proven:**
- ✅ Strong product-market fit in Trinidad & Tobago
- ✅ Scalable demand generation model
- ✅ Predictable revenue streams (€35K MRR target)
- ✅ Replicable sales and onboarding processes
- ✅ Clear path to profitability (€44K net cashflow Year 1)

### The Franchise Concept

We're not just selling software—we're selling a **proven business model** with:
- **Predictable ROI:** €219K investment → €44K net cashflow in Year 1
- **Replicable Playbook:** Every process documented, every metric tracked
- **Proven Product:** Factorial's comprehensive HR platform
- **Market Validation:** 25 customers target, 18% conversion rate
- **Support System:** Training, enablement, and ongoing partnership
