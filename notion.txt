    - *Product-Market Fit Insights*
        - **Why clients chose Factorial (Closed Wons):**
            - Most competitors focus on single specialist tools (e.g., ATS, LMS, payroll, T&A, engagement), not full HR suites.
            - Lack of alternatives offering interconnected modules and outdated local players.
            - Very limited providers can cover multiple countries and offer local support.
            - Strong demand for advanced HR processes (compensation management, payroll hands-off, skill gap analysis, analytics) without the cost/complexity of enterprise tools.
        - **Why clients passed on Factorial (Closed Losts):**
            - Majority of losses account for the current sales motion.
            - Main closed lost reasons are due to **timing** (short sales cycle push) and/or **lack of responsiveness** characteristic of a predominantly outbound motion.
            - Improving the motion is key to directly increasing the win potential.
    - *Demand Generation Activities*
